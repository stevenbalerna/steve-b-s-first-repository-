                My Name is Steven Balerna.  I have recently started UNCC Coding Boot Camp.  
                I was born in NJ when I was younger but moved to NC over 20 years ago.  
                I have been married for over two years to my wife, Shakira and I have a daughter, Sienna, who is almost four months old.
                I graduated college from UNCC.  I am a sports fan of the Lakers, Eagles, and Phillies.
